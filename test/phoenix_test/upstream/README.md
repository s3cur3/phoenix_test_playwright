Copied from https://github.com/germsel/phoenix_test

These tests ensure continued compatability with the `pheonix_test` API.
They are copied regularly.

Ideally they should not be changed, to make future updates easy.
For practical purposes, some minimal changes are required.
Most noteably, some tests have to be `@tag skip`ped (explanation given as tag value).
